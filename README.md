The project delivers a fully functional parallel encryption/decryption tool that demonstrates significant performance improvement over conventional sequential methods. The main deliverables include:
•	Complete source code (C++ + OpenSSL) with documentation
•	CLI tool for real-time encryption/decryption
•	Benchmarking reports comparing sequential vs parallel execution
•	A detailed final project report (design, methodology, testing, results)
•	A working demonstration showing speed performance on various file types
This project will serve as a practical implementation of parallel computing, cryptography, and operating system concepts.
